# Backlog
- All parameters as arguments
- Stacked plots for share of population by state
- Run multiple simulations at same time - and graph all results
- Remove the ticks from the region plot
- Add hub simulation
- Add multiple regions with travel between
- Add self-isolation
- Add quarantining
- Implement dynamic policies - e.g. start self-isolation after X cases
