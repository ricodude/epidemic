# Backlog
- Make simulations more efficient - IN PROGRESS
   - Figure out why random progression not the same
   - Try for more performance
- Scale size of fonts for multiple plots
- Remove the ticks from the region plot
- Add hub simulation
- Add multiple regions with travel between
- Add self-isolation
- Add quarantining
- Implement dynamic policies - e.g. start self-isolation after X cases
- Add SimRecorder - that records the simulation as it runs (at speed), generates a SimHistory and can then be plotted later
- Proper timing for pauses - i.e. from start of run.  Maybe.
- Print parameters under legend
